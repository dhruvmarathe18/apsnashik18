Being the youngest country in the world with the majority of its population in its thirties, we have nowhere to go, but forward. The rest of the world is increasingly seeing as the next natural global leader. We have taken just the first toddler’s steps to this goal. However, before we begin the marathon, we have to learn how to walk. This ability will come only through an educational revolution that will enable our youth to match up to international standards – and that has to begin at the very basic level of teaching-learning activity.<br> <br>The Delhi Public School Society, established more than six decades ago has been a visionary in this regard and has striven to provide a holistic education to its students through the DPS chain which now encompasses over 180 schools in India and abroad. All our schools have geared-up to take on the challenges of the future head-on. Delhi Public Schools are not just about education. We perceive our role as the custodian of our country’s future and accordingly strive to encourage our children to excel not only at academics, but as a responsible citizen of tomorrow with a sense of duty and responsibility towards our nation. They are encouraged to appreciate the fragility of our eco-system and respect nature. Each child that steps into the sanctum of DPS, walks out as an aware, educated and ethically sensitive global denizen for tomorrow.<br><br> I welcome you and and your child in this wonderful family and wish you the best for a very bright future.<br><br> With warm wishes<br> <strong style="color: #03834b;">Vinod Ramesh Marathe</strong> <br>Chairman, APS Nashik&nbsp;</div>

        Education is not just a process of imparting knowledge but to nurture the child for a lifelong process which creates an understanding of moral and ethical values to guide once life on a righteous path.
        
         
        
        We at Delhi Public School Nashik focus both on the scholastic and co-scholastic activities of the students to build a sound mind in a sound body. The school has a vision to reach out to every learner by adapting to different types of instructional strategies – “Project Based Learning”, “Student Led Conference”, “Communication & Presentation”, “Critical Thinking”, “Reflective Questioning”, “Tier 1 and Tier 2 Teaching” and so on..
        
         
        
        The school does not believe in rote memorization and encourages students to showcase their learning outcomes through the various means.
        
         
        
        We are a progressive school, who believes in effective and innovative professional development that encourages teachers to reflective and to continuously examine our practice to provide quality teaching and learning to each Dipsite.
        
         
        
        DPS Nashik has a history of academic excellence as well as in arenas such as Sport, Dance, Music, Social Skills and more. We have been able to achieve these solely by the commitment and have been able to achieve these solely by the commitment and enthusiasm of students, staff, and parents, all these supported by very strong Management.</i><br><br> With warm wishes<br> <strong style="color: #03834b;">Priyanka Vinod Marathe</strong> <br>Principal, APS Nashik&nbsp;</div>
